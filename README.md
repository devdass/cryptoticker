# cryptoticker
This is a project I had done in December 2017 during the Bitcoin bull run. A number of crypto miners and investors had expressed interested in my work, asking me if they could buy their own. I had intended to develop the project into a product, but I was quite busy with Uni work, and the market became apathetic post-crash. I have since decided to make my code publically available. I have also made some modifications and cut it down quite a bit in an effort to make it more understandable - I have not uploaded these changes yet, but I will soon.


My work utilises the fantastic work of @hzeller:

This is a work-in-progress.

So far using my publicly available code, I am able to pull down live prices of multiple cryptocurrency pairs and have them scroll across the LED matrix display, just like that of wall street stock tickers.

The code is also able to be alterd to pull down RSS feeds from news sites and have headlines displayed at specific intervals.

To do:
- Write documentation
- Make code more readable
- Develop webpage control panel
- Offer other exchange data
