WIP RPi LED crypto ticker matrix

My work utilises the fantastic work of @hzeller:
https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix

This is a work-in-progress.

So far using my publicly available code, I am able to pull down live prices of multiple cryptocurrency pairs and have them scroll across the LED matrix display, just like that of wall street stock tickers.

The code is also able to be alterd to pull down RSS feeds from news sites and have headlines displayed at specific intervals.

To do:
- Write documentation
- Make code more readable
- Develop webpage control panel
- Offer other exchange data
